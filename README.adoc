= wordcloud

Creates a positive/negative circular tag cloud from two wordlists using Kenny Cason's kumo package

== Usage

The two input files are specified by the environment variables POSITIVE and NEGATIVE.
Each should refer to the full path of the text file, e.g.
`POSITIVE=~/myfiles/knownwords.txt`

Use "_" inside the word lists to make phrases appear in the tag cloud.

== Building

See the note about the font scaler (which Cason calls "scalar") in my source code.

Then do

`mvn clean package assembly:single`
